# BRGaitLab
Where Legs Meet the Ground

# Clinical Report Generation 
Contains several algorithms:
- PreProcessing
- Gait Analysis
- NonGait Analysis
- Mode Filter
- Stair climb
- Streamlit App "GaitViewerApp"

# Description – what the project does and why it exists.
The project exists to improve the current methods of how clinicians collect and report user generated gait metrics in the form of a descriptive report that can be utilized in a time effective manner with no additional cost to produce. 

# Features - major capabilities or highlights.
Gait Analysis Report Algorithm-
File import, .txt to .csv format conversion and column renaming 
Gait analysis by mode-phase sequencing 
Segment gait cycle into stance, pre-swing, swing 
Gait phase Durations (Stance, Swing, Stance:Swing ratio, Gait cycle) 
Overall trial time/ device “On time”
NonGait_Analysis Report Algorithm- 

Mode Filter Algorithm- 
File import, .txt to .csv format conversion and column renaming 
Mode identification & labeling
Event count & duration 
Percentage of total duration
Overall trial time/ device “On time”

Streamlit App "GaitViewerApp"-
Webapp version of Gait Analysis Report Algorithm
